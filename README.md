This is the our Skeeball DLD Project that we showcased at DPEC for the Spring 2025 semester. It uses 1 main FSM which cycles through the start screen, transition screen, game screen, and the end screen. Developed to work alongside our skeeball rig that we made by hand, it provides a complex yet understandable and rich scoring system that is enjoyable for the players. This project was awarded second runner up at the exhibition.
